# gateway-vm

`gateway-vm` runs Traefik ingress, Homepage, Technitium DNS, Gluetun,
netboot.xyz, NetBird, and Tailscale.

Fleet inventory lives in `../../hosts.nix`. Host configuration lives in
`configuration.nix` and imports service modules from `../../modules/gateway/`.

## Host Model

Important host values:

- FQDN: `gateway-vm.home.arpa`
- IP: `10.2.20.112`
- Gateway: `10.2.20.1`
- DNS: `10.2.20.1`, `9.9.9.9`
- Time zone: `America/New_York`
- Admin user: `smoke`
- VM disk: `/dev/sda`
- VM RAM: `8 GB`
- VM CPU cores: `4`

State paths:

- `/srv/appsdata/gluetun`
- `/srv/appsdata/technitium-dns-server`
- `/srv/appsdata/netbird`
- `/srv/appsdata/tailscale`

Gateway state is backed up with Restic to
`/mnt/backup/restic/appdata/gateway-vm`. The restore-check target is
`/var/tmp/gateway-state-restore-check`.

## Service Access

Service access:

- Traefik HTTP ingress: `http://10.2.20.112`
- Traefik HTTPS ingress: `https://10.2.20.112`
- Traefik dashboard: `http://10.2.20.112:8080/dashboard/`
- Traefik Prometheus metrics: `http://10.2.20.112:8080/metrics`
- Homepage: `http://homepage.h/` through Traefik and `http://10.2.20.112:8082/` directly
- DNS: `10.2.20.112:53` over TCP and UDP
- DNS-over-TLS: `10.2.20.112:853`
- Technitium admin HTTP: `http://10.2.20.112:5380`
- Technitium HTTPS and DNS-over-HTTPS: `https://10.2.20.112:53443`
- Gluetun HTTP proxy: `http://10.2.20.112:8888`
- Gluetun WebUI: `http://gluetun.h/` through Traefik; backend only on `127.0.0.1:3000`
- netboot.xyz TFTP: `10.2.20.112:69/udp`, boot file `netboot.xyz.efi`
- NetBird: disabled for now; state preserved at `/srv/appsdata/netbird`
- Tailscale: `10.2.20.112:41641/udp`

Technitium admin HTTP is available directly at `http://10.2.20.112:5380` and
through Traefik at `http://technitium.h/`.

Homepage is declared in Nix and generated into `/etc/homepage-dashboard`. Its
first-pass dashboard lists Gateway-owned `.h` routes, including MediaVM-backed
routes that Traefik already proxies, plus direct Gateway IP URLs. It does not
use service API widgets or mutable UI configuration in this pass.

Traefik writes JSON access logs to the `traefik.service` journal. Prometheus
metrics are exposed on the existing dashboard entrypoint at
`http://10.2.20.112:8080/metrics`. OpenTelemetry tracing is declared in the
Gateway Traefik module but should only be enabled after an OTLP collector
endpoint is available.

`gateway-vm` intentionally pins Traefik to the upstream `3.7.1` Linux AMD64
release artifact, Technitium DNS to the upstream `15.2.0` source release, and
Gluetun to `ghcr.io/qdm12/gluetun@sha256:2f33c71e5e164fcd51a962cb950134df25155593edf0c3e1201f888d027049b4`
while the rest of the fleet remains on the locked `nixpkgs` package set.

Gluetun uses Private Internet Access over OpenVPN. The HTTP proxy is exposed on
the LAN without separate proxy authentication; access is controlled by LAN
reachability and the host firewall. PIA VPN port forwarding and fixed region
selection are disabled for now. Gluetun's control API is authenticated with a
SOPS-managed API key and is only consumed by the WebUI sidecar inside Gluetun's
container network namespace.

The Gluetun WebUI runs as `podman-gluetun-webui.service` and is available on
the LAN through Traefik at `http://gluetun.h/`. It has no native UI login, so
the direct backend listener stays bound to `127.0.0.1:3000` and is not opened
on the LAN as a separate port.

Technitium serves the `.h` service zone. Wildcard DNS resolves `*.h` to
`gateway-vm` at `10.2.20.112`, where Traefik routes known hostnames to their
backends.
VM hostnames stay under `home.arpa` and are managed outside this Gateway
service zone. Clients must use `10.2.20.112` as DNS, or the LAN DNS/DHCP server
must forward/delegate `.h` to `10.2.20.112`, for these names to resolve.

If a browser shows `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN` for a `.h` name, confirm
whether the client is asking Gateway DNS:

```sh
dig gluetun.h
dig @10.2.20.112 gluetun.h
```

The first command must query `10.2.20.112`, or the LAN DNS server must have a
conditional forward/delegation for `.h` to `10.2.20.112`. A temporary
single-client workaround is adding `10.2.20.112 gluetun.h` to that client's
hosts file.

Traefik ingress routes are declared explicitly for:

- `homepage.h`
- `technitium.h`
- `traefik.h`
- `gluetun.h`
- `jellyfin.h`
- `audiobookshelf.h`
- `kavita.h`
- `sonarr.h`
- `radarr.h`
- `prowlarr.h`
- `bazarr.h`
- `qbittorrent.h`
- `sabnzbd.h`
- `jellyseerr.h`

For netboot.xyz, configure the LAN DHCP server to point option 66 at
`10.2.20.112` and option 67 at `netboot.xyz.efi`. `gateway-vm` serves TFTP but
does not take over DHCP for the subnet.

## Secrets

Required secrets:

- `admin-password-hash`
- `gluetun-control-api-key`
- `gluetun-openvpn-username`
- `gluetun-openvpn-password`
- `smb-credentials`
- `restic-password`
- `technitium-admin-username`
- `technitium-admin-password`

Normal edit flow:

```sh
nix develop
sops secrets/secrets.yaml
sops --decrypt secrets/secrets.yaml >/dev/null && echo ok
```

`gateway-vm` decrypts secrets using `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key`. After a
new VM install or host key change, capture the host recipient:

```sh
ssh smoke@10.2.20.112 'sudo ssh-keygen -y -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key' | ssh-to-age
```

Add the printed `age1...` recipient to `.sops.yaml`, then rekey:

```sh
sops updatekeys secrets/secrets.yaml
sops --decrypt secrets/secrets.yaml >/dev/null && echo ok
```

Keep `restic-password` stable. It is the encryption key for the Restic
repository; changing it makes existing snapshots unreadable with the new value.

## Bootstrap

Use this flow after preparing a fresh `gateway-vm` install. The destructive
`nixos-anywhere` VM install is managed outside this fleet repo before
declarative deployment begins.

```sh
nix develop
scripts/gateway-vm/bootstrap-gateway-vm.sh run
```

The bootstrap phases are resumable:

- `check-local-readiness`: verifies tools, encrypted secrets, `nix flake check`, and `colmena build --on gateway-vm`.
- `enable-vm-secret-access`: captures the gateway SSH host key, adds the age recipient to `.sops.yaml`, and runs `sops updatekeys`.
- `dry-activate-gateway-vm`: validates the activation plan with `colmena apply --on gateway-vm dry-activate`.
- `deploy-gateway-vm`: runs the guarded gateway deployment.
- `verify-gateway-vm`: confirms hostnames, service health, listener ports, Traefik routes, Gluetun proxy egress, and Restic backup/restore validation.

Individual phases:

```sh
scripts/gateway-vm/bootstrap-gateway-vm.sh check-local-readiness
scripts/gateway-vm/bootstrap-gateway-vm.sh enable-vm-secret-access
scripts/gateway-vm/bootstrap-gateway-vm.sh dry-activate-gateway-vm
scripts/gateway-vm/bootstrap-gateway-vm.sh deploy-gateway-vm
scripts/gateway-vm/bootstrap-gateway-vm.sh verify-gateway-vm
```

## Upgrade

Use this flow for an already-running `gateway-vm`. It deploys the current repo
state only; update and review `flake.lock` or host-local package pins
separately before running it.

```sh
nix develop
scripts/gateway-vm/upgrade-gateway-vm.sh run
```

The wrapper runs these phases in order:

- `check-upgrade-readiness`: verifies dev-shell tools, encrypted secrets, non-interactive SSH, `nix flake check`, and `colmena build --on gateway-vm`.
- `create-pre-upgrade-backup`: starts a gateway appdata Restic backup and lists the latest matching snapshots.
- `dry-activate-gateway-vm`: validates the activation plan with `colmena apply --on gateway-vm dry-activate`.
- `deploy-gateway-vm`: runs the guarded `gateway-vm` deployment and normalizes the transient hostname.
- `verify-gateway-vm`: confirms service health, listener ports, Traefik routes, DNS records, Gluetun proxy egress, backup/restore validation, and tmpfiles declarations.

The upgrade workflow never restores appdata automatically. Use the restore
workflow only when recovering from a failed host or bad application state.

The phases can also be run individually:

```sh
scripts/gateway-vm/upgrade-gateway-vm.sh check-upgrade-readiness
scripts/gateway-vm/upgrade-gateway-vm.sh create-pre-upgrade-backup
scripts/gateway-vm/upgrade-gateway-vm.sh dry-activate-gateway-vm
scripts/gateway-vm/upgrade-gateway-vm.sh deploy-gateway-vm
scripts/gateway-vm/upgrade-gateway-vm.sh verify-gateway-vm
```

## Deploy

Use plain Colmena commands from inside `nix develop`.

```sh
colmena build --on gateway-vm
colmena apply --on gateway-vm dry-activate
colmena apply --on gateway-vm switch
```

The guarded deploy helper checks local SOPS decryption and confirms the VM has
a matching SOPS recipient before switching:

```sh
scripts/gateway-vm/deploy-gateway.sh
```

## Backups and Restore

`gateway-vm` backs up `/srv/appsdata` with Restic.

- Service: `gateway-state-backup.service`
- Timer: `gateway-state-backup.timer`
- Source: `/srv/appsdata`
- Repository: `/mnt/backup/restic/appdata/gateway-vm`
- Password file: `/run/secrets/restic-password`
- Non-destructive restore validation: `gateway-state-restore-check.service`

Recommended consistency-first manual backup from the repo development shell:

```sh
scripts/gateway-vm/create-gateway-backup.sh
```

That script mounts `/mnt/backup`, stops the Gateway backup timer, stops active
stateful Gateway services, runs the Restic backup and restore validation, lists
recent snapshots, restarts services and the timer, then runs the normal Gateway
service validation.

Post-deploy validation:

```sh
scripts/gateway-vm/test-gateway-services.sh
```

That script verifies service health, listener ports, Traefik routes, Gluetun
proxy egress, Homepage generated config, and gateway state backup/restore
validation.

Lower-level backup and restore validation on `gateway-vm` for debugging:

```sh
mount /mnt/backup
systemctl start gateway-state-backup.service
systemctl start gateway-state-restore-check.service
systemctl status gateway-state-backup.service gateway-state-restore-check.service
```

Restore outline:

1. Deploy `gateway-vm` once to create users, secrets, mounts, and units.
2. Stop Technitium, Gluetun, NetBird, and Tailscale before replacing state.
3. Mount `/mnt/backup`.
4. Choose a `gateway-vm` appdata snapshot ID.
5. Restore the snapshot to `/` with `restic --verify`.
6. Run `systemd-tmpfiles --create`.
7. Restart `homepage-dashboard.service`, `technitium-dns-server.service`, `podman-gluetun.service`, `podman-gluetun-webui.service`, and `tailscaled.service`; restart `netbird.service` too if NetBird is re-enabled.

Homepage has no authoritative mutable app state in this fleet pass. Restore its
dashboard by redeploying the Gateway Nix configuration.

The same service and recovery model is generated on `gateway-vm` at
`/etc/fleet/gateway-vm.md`. Keep this README and the generated recovery notes
in sync when backup or restore behavior changes.

## Operations

Check service status through Colmena:

```sh
colmena exec --on gateway-vm -- systemctl status traefik
colmena exec --on gateway-vm -- systemctl status homepage-dashboard
colmena exec --on gateway-vm -- systemctl status technitium-dns-server
colmena exec --on gateway-vm -- systemctl status podman-gluetun
colmena exec --on gateway-vm -- systemctl status podman-gluetun-webui
colmena exec --on gateway-vm -- systemctl status atftpd
colmena exec --on gateway-vm -- systemctl status tailscaled
colmena exec --on gateway-vm -- systemctl status gateway-state-backup.timer
```

Roll back a NixOS generation from the host:

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback
```

You can also reboot and choose an earlier generation from the bootloader.

## Safety Notes

- `hosts.nix` declares the `gateway-vm` disk as `/dev/sda`; any installer or partitioning command against that disk is destructive.
- `gateway-vm` serves TFTP for netboot.xyz but does not take over DHCP for the subnet.
- Keep auth keys and service secrets in encrypted secrets only.
- Do not write plaintext secrets into Nix files, generated configs, recovery notes, logs, or chat.
