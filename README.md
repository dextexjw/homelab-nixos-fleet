# Homelab NixOS Fleet

This repository is my personal NixOS homelab fleet. It is managed as a Nix
flake and deployed with Colmena.

The current fleet is intentionally small:

- `gateway-vm` runs Traefik ingress, Technitium DNS, netboot.xyz, NetBird, and Tailscale.
- `media-vm` runs Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf, Kavita, ARR apps, downloads, SMB media mounts, and appdata backups.

Treat this repo as the source of truth for hosts, services, secrets workflow,
and recovery notes. The fleet-wide service standard is captured in
`PRINCIPLES.md`; new Gateway, Security, Identity, and other service modules
should follow that blueprint before being treated as production-ready.

## Current Hosts

| Host | IP | Tags | Role | Runbook |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gateway-vm` | `10.2.20.112` | `control-plane`, `gateway` | Ingress, DNS, netboot, mesh networking | [`hosts/gateway-vm/README.md`](hosts/gateway-vm/README.md) |
| `media-vm` | `10.2.20.113` | `media` | Media services, downloads, SMB media, Restic appdata backups | [`hosts/media-vm/README.md`](hosts/media-vm/README.md) |

Inventory lives in `hosts.nix`. Per-host configuration and host-specific
runbooks live under `hosts/<name>/`.

## Repository Map

- `flake.nix`: inputs, development shell, and Colmena hive.
- `hosts.nix`: host IPs, users, tags, nameservers, and VM constants.
- `hosts/common.nix`: shared Nix, SSH, user, firewall, package, and node-exporter defaults.
- `hosts/gateway-vm/`: gateway host configuration, hardware profile, and runbook.
- `hosts/media-vm/`: media host configuration, hardware profile, and runbook.
- `modules/gateway/`: Traefik, Technitium, netboot.xyz, NetBird, Tailscale, and gateway backup modules.
- `modules/media/stack.nix`: the main `media-vm` service stack, SMB mounts, backups, and recovery notes.
- `modules/monitoring/`: available Prometheus, Grafana, and node exporter modules.
- `modules/networking/reverse-proxy.nix`: available nginx virtual hosts module.
- `modules/security/self-signed-ca.nix`: internal self-signed CA and per-domain cert generation.
- `modules/dev/`: available Jenkins and Gitea modules.
- `modules/apps/freshrss.nix`: available module, not currently enabled.
- `secrets/example-secrets.yaml`: expected SOPS secret shape.
- `secrets/secrets.yaml`: encrypted real secrets.
- `scripts/`: local helper scripts for checks, guarded deploys, bootstrap, backup validation, and restore.

## Documentation Model

Use the root README as the fleet map: what exists, how the repo is organized,
and how to deploy safely.

Use the host READMEs as operational runbooks:

- [`hosts/gateway-vm/README.md`](hosts/gateway-vm/README.md): direct ports, Traefik routes, netboot notes, state backup, bootstrap, and validation.
- [`hosts/media-vm/README.md`](hosts/media-vm/README.md): service URLs, media/appdata paths, SMB mounts, secrets, bootstrap, upgrade, backup, restore, and validation.

Generated on-host notes under `/etc/fleet/<host>.md` are emergency recovery
references. Keep them aligned with the host README when changing backup,
restore, or service recovery behavior.

## Local Workflow

Enter the development shell before using Colmena, SOPS, age, Restic, or the
helper scripts:

```sh
nix develop
```

With `direnv`, `.envrc` loads the same flake shell automatically.

Useful local checks:

```sh
nix flake check
colmena build --on media-vm
colmena apply --on media-vm dry-activate
```

The repo also has a focused check helper:

```sh
scripts/check.sh
```

## Deployments

Use plain Colmena commands from inside `nix develop`.

Deploy one host:

```sh
colmena apply --on media-vm switch
colmena apply --on gateway-vm switch
```

Deploy by tag only when intentionally targeting a group:

```sh
colmena apply --on @media switch
colmena apply --on @gateway switch
```

Deploy the whole fleet only when that is really the goal:

```sh
colmena apply switch
```

Guarded deploy helpers check local SOPS decryption and confirm the target VM has
a matching SOPS recipient before switching:

```sh
scripts/deploy-media.sh
scripts/deploy-gateway.sh
```

See the host runbooks for bootstrap, upgrade, backup, restore, and validation
flows.

## Secrets

Secrets are managed with SOPS and deployed through `sops-nix`.

Expected shared secrets:

- `admin-password-hash`
- `smb-credentials`
- `restic-password`

Service-specific secrets are documented in the host runbooks and
`secrets/example-secrets.yaml`.

Normal edit flow:

```sh
nix develop
sops secrets/secrets.yaml
sops --decrypt secrets/secrets.yaml >/dev/null && echo ok
```

If `secrets/secrets.yaml` is missing, start from the example and encrypt it:

```sh
cp secrets/example-secrets.yaml secrets/secrets.yaml
sops --encrypt --in-place secrets/secrets.yaml
```

Each VM decrypts secrets using `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key`. After a new VM
install or host key change, capture the host recipient, add the printed
`age1...` value to `.sops.yaml`, then rekey:

```sh
ssh smoke@10.2.20.113 'sudo ssh-keygen -y -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key' | ssh-to-age
ssh smoke@10.2.20.112 'sudo ssh-keygen -y -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key' | ssh-to-age
sops updatekeys secrets/secrets.yaml
sops --decrypt secrets/secrets.yaml >/dev/null && echo ok
```

Keep `restic-password` stable. It is the encryption key for Restic
repositories; changing it makes existing snapshots unreadable with the new
value.

## Changing the Fleet

Service modules live under `modules/<domain>/` and expose options under the
`fleet.<domain>.<service>` namespace. Follow the existing module shape:

1. Define options under `options`.
2. Gate implementation with `mkIf cfg.enable`.
3. Import the module from the host that should run it.
4. Enable it in that host's `fleet.*` config.
5. Run `nix flake check`, build the host, and dry-activate before switching.

For `media-vm` changes touching the media stack, SMB mounts, SOPS secrets, or
Restic, deploy and then run:

```sh
scripts/test-media-backup.sh
```

Keep README changes and `/etc/fleet/<host>.md` recovery notes aligned when
backup, restore, or recovery behavior changes.

## Safety Notes

- Host disks are declared in `hosts.nix`; installer or partitioning commands against those disks are destructive.
- Keep secret values encrypted before committing.
- Do not paste decrypted secrets into commits, issues, chat, logs, or shell history.
- The base firewall opens SSH and service modules open their own required ports.
- `gateway-vm` serves the declarative `home.arpa` zone in Technitium; clients
  must use `10.2.20.112` for DNS, or the LAN DNS/DHCP server must forward or
  delegate `home.arpa` to `10.2.20.112`, before browser URLs like
  `traefik.home.arpa` will resolve.
